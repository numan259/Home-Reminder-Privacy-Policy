1. Location Data

Home Reminder uses your device’s location locally on your device to trigger reminders when you enter or exit a saved place.
We do not collect, store, or transmit your location to any server.
Background location access is required so that reminders can function correctly even when the app is closed or not actively in use.

2. Personal Data

We do not ask for or collect your name, email, or any personally identifiable information.
All reminder text and app data are stored locally on your device.

3. Third-Party Services (AdMob)

The app uses Google AdMob to display ads.
AdMob may collect information such as:

Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID)

Ad performance data

This data is collected by Google, not by us.

Users in the EEA can manage or opt out of personalized ads through:
Settings → Google → Ads.
